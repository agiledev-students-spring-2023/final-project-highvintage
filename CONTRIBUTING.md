# Guide to Contributing

## Team Norms

Team members may solicit help from others by communication in Discord.

- Post a new thread regarding a technical issue. (e.g. "Need help with x,y,z")
- For non-technical questions/help on designs or features, leave a note in the project discord channel. (e.g. "Does anyone have opinion on x,y,z")
- Anyone available may help to solve the issue.

## GitHub Workflow & Coding Standards

### GitHub Workflow

- Team members will work using branch protection
  - At least one pull request review is required before merging
  - Reviewer must not be the same person as the author of the pull request
  - Bypassing branch protection and force pushes have been disabled (but can be subject to change)
  - No current criteria for passing status checks or successful depolyment (but may be subject to change)
